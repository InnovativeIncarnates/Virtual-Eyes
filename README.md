# Virtual-Eyes
An android application that captures images and classifies the objects present in the image. The application can serve the purpose of "eyes" to a blind person. In the back end, the application runs a classifier that uses a weight file generated by training our own data set in the YOLO(Real Time Object Detection System) model.
